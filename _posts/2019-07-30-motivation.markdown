As the deadlines continue to come and go, and the lesson assignments become more and more routine, I find myself still as motivated as when I first started. As people ask how I'm doing in the program, the question on whether I'm still intrigued always follows. And the answer has been the same since I first applied to Flatiron. Every lesson leaves me wanting more and every mental test makes me wish I started this path sooner. 
Discussing my motivation and interest in the program more in detail with close friends, it's challenged me to really think about what specifically keeps me going. While I believe there are multiple underlying reasons, the two that seem to stick out the most are the wide span of learning opportunities in the field and the satisfaction of accomplishing a new skill. I have always enjoyed learning but as like most people, if the subject isn't a personal interest, I hit a point where I no longer feel the need or want to know more. When it's come to tech and the coding world, I never see hitting that point. Between books, videos, and a classic Google search, I feel as if I'm just beginning to get my feet wet in an industry full of opportunity. And as I work my way through each lesson, it makes me feel as if I'm solving a puzzle and less like work that needs to be done. The constant need to learn more and understand the process keeps me motivated to push through the toughest lessons. Coding started with a consistent interest but has become a personal passion through the tools provided in this program.
Overall, I can't wait to see the progress made as I continue through the lessons and the opportunities gained. My motivation will continue to come from the challenges, personal accomplishments, and desire to be apart of something bigger in this field.
